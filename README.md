# ResistKernelC Project

## Overview
The ResistKernelC project implements a program that computes a minimum cost distance matrix sum using a grid of costs. The program is designed to process a raster grid and calculate the cost associated with moving through the grid based on specified parameters.

## Files
- `src/ResistKernelC.cpp`: Contains the main function and the implementation of the cost distance matrix sum calculation.
- `CMakeLists.txt`: Configuration file for CMake, specifying project details and source files.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Building the Project
To build the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have CMake installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a build directory:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
4. Run CMake to configure the project:
   ```
   cmake ..
   ```
5. Build the project:
   ```
   make
   ```

## Running the Program
After building the project, you can run the executable generated in the `build` directory. The program will read input from a specified text file and output the results to another file.
